# ERC-1155 Transfer Specification ‚Äî Certora Rules

This specification verifies the correct behavior of the `safeTransferFrom` function in an ERC-1155 token contract using Certora Prover. The rules are written in CVL (Certora Verification Language) and cover core functionality, edge cases, and permission enforcement.

## ‚úÖ Rules Overview

### `safeTransferShouldUpdateBalances`

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that when a valid transfer is made, the sender‚Äôs balance decreases and the recipient‚Äôs balance increases by the correct amount.

**Conditions:**
- Sender must be the transaction initiator.
- Sender and recipient must be different.
- Sender must have a sufficient balance.

**Assertions:**
- Sender's balance is reduced by the transferred amount.
- Recipient's balance is increased by the transferred amount.

---

### `safeTransferRevertsIfInsufficientBalance`

**Purpose:**  
Verifies that a transfer is correctly reverted if the sender attempts to send more tokens than they own.

**Conditions:**
- Sender is the transaction initiator.
- Sender‚Äôs balance is less than the transfer amount.

**Assertions:**
- The transfer must revert.

---

## üß™ Edge Case Rules

### `safeTransferToSelfKeepsBalanceUnchanged`

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that transferring tokens to oneself does not affect the token balance.

**Conditions:**
- Sender is the transaction initiator.
- Sender has enough tokens to transfer.

**Assertions:**
- Balance remains unchanged after the transfer.

---

### `safeTransferZeroAmountNoEffect`

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that transferring zero tokens does not alter the balances of either the sender or recipient.

**Conditions:**
- Sender is the transaction initiator.
- Sender and recipient are different.

**Assertions:**
- Both sender and recipient balances remain unchanged.

---

### `safeTransferExactBalanceShouldZeroSender`

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that transferring exactly the full balance of a token results in the sender's balance becoming zero.

**Conditions:**
- Sender is the transaction initiator.
- Sender and recipient are different.
- Sender has a non-zero balance.

**Assertions:**
- Sender's balance becomes zero after the transfer.

---

## üîê Permission Rules

### `safeTransferRevertsIfNotApproved`

**Purpose:**  
Ensures that transfers initiated by non-owners who are not approved as operators are correctly reverted.

**Conditions:**
- Sender is **not** the token owner.
- Sender is **not** approved as an operator.
- Token owner has sufficient balance.

**Assertions:**
- The transfer must revert.

# Results

## ‚úÖ Successfully Verified Rules

The following rules were verified without any issues:

| Rule                          | Status  | Description                                                      |
|------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `envfreeFuncsStaticCheck`    | Passed  | Ensures that view functions such as `balanceOf` are pure         |
| `safeTransferZeroAmountNoEffect` | Timeout/Loop | Expected that a 0-amount transfer has no side effects       |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules Failed Due to Loop Unrolling Limit

The verifier hit the default loop iteration limit (1), preventing complete analysis. This doesn't imply that the rule failed ‚Äî just that the prover could not fully verify the behavior.

| Rule                                     | Issue                          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `safeTransferZeroAmountNoEffect`         | Unwinding condition in a loop  |
| `safeTransferExactBalanceShouldZeroSender` | Unwinding condition in a loop |
| `safeTransferShouldUpdateBalances`       | Unwinding condition in a loop  |
| `safeTransferToSelfKeepsBalanceUnchanged`| Unwinding condition in a loop  |

These rules likely involve internal loops or external calls to `onERC1155Received`, which complicate full analysis under default settings.
